            <p class="paragraph">James Myles, the Seattle-based saxophonist and composer has performed with such groups as The Youth Orchestra of the Americas, Chelsea Symphony, MSM Orchestra, TACTUS, Manhattan Saxophone Quartet, Face the Music, and Cascade Symphony Orchestra. 
                He has worked under the batons of such conductors as Valery Gergeiv, H. Robert Reynolds, Carlos Miguel Prieto, and David Gilbert. 
                As a new music performer, he has been involved with many premieres by such composers as John Lissauer, Hayes Biggs, and Walter Hartley. 
                In addition, he is an active composer, whose music has been heard in such venues as Seattle Symphony’s Benaroya Hall, John C. Borden Auditorium, Greenfield Hall, and Pforzheimer Hall
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">In addition to concert saxophone playing, James keeps himself active with all types of music.
                    From R&B to Indie, from Big Band to Brass Band, James’ musical projects are as diverse as they come.
                    When he’s not playing, he stays active as an educator - teaching a full studio of private students and regularly giving clinics across the state.
