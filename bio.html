    <p>After studying Saxophone and Composition at the Manhattan School of Music, James returned to Seattle to create and teach music. A regular performer on the alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones, James keeps himself active with all types of music. From R&B to Indie, from Big Band to Brass Band, from Classical to Metal, James’ musical projects are almost as eclectic as he is. When he’s not playing, he stays active as an educator, teaching over 40 private students and regularly giving clinics across the state.</p>
